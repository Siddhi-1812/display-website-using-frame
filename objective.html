<h2>Goal of my life</h2>
<p>My Personal Goals as a Student An obvious goal 
as a working adult returning to school is, of course, 
to earn a degree. My overall goal is no different than 
any other student, however, I also have several personal
goals I hope to achieve while attending the College. 
Some of these goals are to acquire new skills and enhance 
my current business abilities, to apply what I learn in the 
classroom to forward my career, and to feel personal 
satisfaction of finishing something I started. 
Already having experience in the business world has 
proven to me that it is essential to have skills to 
maintain and improve daily functions  .
